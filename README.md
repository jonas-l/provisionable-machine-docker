Docker image for Provisionable Machine
======================================

This image is useful for testing provisioning scripts. It builds on top of [Alpine image][alpine-image] and adds OpenRC init system which allows managing services. In addition, _ssh_ and _sftp_ server accepts user with `root` username and `root` password.


[alpine-image]: https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/
